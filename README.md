# TermPilot

TermPilot uses OpenAI GPT-3 to find the terminal command you're looking for, just type what you're looking to do in English. This is just the initial MVP. More polish and documentation is coming. 

## Contributing

I'm definitely looking to build a community and merge contributions. See the ROADMAP for things I'd like to do but don't necessarily have the bandwidth for personally.

## Roadmap

## Short Term

* bash integration on par with zsh integration
* any other shell integration that people care about
* having to use a temp file the way I do seems a bit hacky, I just don't have the shell foo to improve on this.
* display a spinner while we're waiting on OpenAI
## Medium Term

* local models so you don't have to pay for OpenAI api. Maybe LLAMA or a LLAMA derrivative can be used?
